name: I want to request a game
description: Game request, for new games or updates of existing games.
Before submitting a game request, please make sure that the game you are requesting is not already in the repository.
Also, be aware that the game you are requesting must be open-source and must comply with the Code Of Conduct.

The game request will be reviewed by the maintainers and, if approved, it will be added to the repository as
a gameName-version.json or as a classic folder in the Games folder.

The main objective to add games to the repository is to provide a way to install and play games in a simple way,
without the need to download and install the game manually. Also, it provides a way to keep the games updated automatically.
